### What is rmtwrld?
Remote world helps remote workers and digital nomads worldwide find caf√©s and workspaces.

### What can rmtworld be
The vision I hold for rmtwrld is to transform it into a product that impeccably caters to the diverse needs of digital nomads spanning the globe.

From effortlessly reserving seats at workspaces while on the move, to providing comprehensive nomad insurance, streamlining the hiring process, and fostering a cohesive global community that embarks on a collective journey. 
In my mind's eye, I foresee rmtworld's evolution into nothing short of an internet-based nation, revolutionizing the way nomads connect and thrive.
